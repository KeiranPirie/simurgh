This file will show you how to setup our database to run on your machine.
1) Run git clone https://github.com/faisalmlalani/simurgh on the www folder of your local host. This will allow you to make edits and test in the same place.

2) Create a database on your sql server. Do this by opening up your sql prompt. If your using wamp server, first make sure wamp is running, then click on the wamp server icon in the bar on the bottom right of the screen. Go to the mysql tab, then mysqlConsole. When in the console, run "create databse simurgh". This will create an empty database named simurgh.

3) Import the database structure. Now run the initializeDB.php file. You can do this by typing in localhost/simurgh/initializeDB.php into the URL of your browser. 
NOTE: This will only work if your username and password are left to default values for you mysql instance. Username="root", Password="").

4) Make sure the data moved over. If you run "show tables;" in your mysql promt, it should show a links, subtopic and topic table.

5)Your done! You can look at the code in initializeDB.php if you want to see how it works.
