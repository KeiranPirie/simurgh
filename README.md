## Overview

#### Description
Caffeine is a mobile application on iOS and Android devices that acts as a scheduler to meet students' needs organizing their schoolwork.

#### Vision Statement
Caffeine is a student-exclusive network that allows its users to keep track of homework, tests, and other deadlines as well as provide general communication for each of their classes. 

#### Motivation
Initially our group was brainstorming various ideas to improve student's experiences on campus. Because this is a software development class, that process involved thinking about how to integrate practices that currently aren't connected online, for example, the excess amount of posters displayed across CU Boulder's campus. We then arrived at a more useful concept to have a hub for all of our class' due dates and major deadlines since there isn't an app that conects all the platforms (Moodle, D2L, Piazza etc.) that CU implements.

Our motivation to create Caffeine came from the shared frustration of having to use multiple vendors for Computer Science classes in addition to Desire2Learn for the majority of other classes at the University of Colorado Boulder. Our hope is to integrate the platforms students are required to use for each of their classes into a single application that allows them to view assignment deadines, be reminded of quiz and exam dates as well as communicate with their classmates in a disscusion board.

#### Risks
1) Not knowing android development
2) Planning consistent meeting times
3) Syncing up the iOS and Android development phases

#### Risk Mitigation Plan
1) Online tutorials!
2) Giving as many updates on our Slack channel so everyone is aware of what our progress is if not every member is able to attend a particular meeting.
3) Problem-solving our issues together so one half of the development team isn't behind the other as the project moves forward.

#### Version Control
We are using GitHub as our version control method because it is the only system that all of our teammates are familiar with. Our project repo is contained here, https://github.com/fasilmlalani/caffeineapp/.

#### Development Method
Our group is going to use the Agile methodology.

#### Collaboration Tool
We've chosen to use Slack to communication throughout this project.
